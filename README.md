# MiniBoosters
This is a plugin that allows you to boost certain things in your world, such as the value of exp!

### Features So Far:
- Physical features:
  - Experience Doubler:
    When activated with the command below, the experience doubler does just that: doubles experience picked up from the ground.
- Commands:
  - /doubleexp:
    Toggles the experience doubler which doubles all experience picked up from the ground, such as from mob kills or breaking ores.
  - /exptracker:
    Toggles the experience tracker which displays in chat the value of an experience orb when it targets you.

### Planned Features:
- Arguments for the /doubleexp command to change how much the experience is multiplied by (with limits).
- Switch the /doubleexp command to a command like /booster with extra arguments to specify what is getting multiplied (i.e. ores, exp, etc.) and add functionality for multiplying those drops.
- A command to get the info on current boosters.

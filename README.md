# MiniBoosters
MiniBoosters is a simple plugin to set multipliers, or "boosters", for things in your server, such as experience!

### Features So Far:
- Physical features:
  - Experience multiplier:
    When activated through the main command, the experience multiplier does just that: multiplies experience picked up from the ground based on the provided multiplier value.
- Commands:
  - /booster:
    The plugin's main command to set multipliers for various game functionalities (currently only exp) as well as listing current boosters and listing all available boosters.
  - /exptracker:
    Toggles the experience tracker which displays in chat the value of an experience orb when it targets you.

### Planned Features:
- Arguments for the /doubleexp command to change how much the experience is multiplied by (with limits).
- Add functionality for specifying what should be boosted (i.e. ores, mob drops, etc.)

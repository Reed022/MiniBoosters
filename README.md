# ReedsPlugin
A collection of the results of Reed screwing around with code, 90% of the time unsuccessfully.

# Features So Far:
- Physical features:
  - Experience Doubler:
    When activated with the command below, the experience doubler does just that: doubles experience picked up from the ground.
- Commands:
  - /doubleexp:
    Toggles the experience doubler which doubles all experience picked up from the ground, such as from mob kills or breaking ores.
    
# Planned Features:
- A command to toggle the experience tracker (chat message showing how much experience each orb you pick up is worth).
- Arguments for the /doubleexp command to change how much the experience is multiplied by (with limits).
- Switch the /doubleexp command to a command like /booster with extra arguments to specify what is getting multiplied (i.e. ores, exp, etc.)
